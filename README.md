1. Copies: $165.29
2. Computers: $132.25; 3. Desks: $69.95

### Question 3: Examine possible performance-influencing variables and compare Nigeria's profitability in 2014 to those of other African nations.
•	Nigeria: -$23,285.19 (Loss)
•	Some profitable African Countries i:
o	Algeria: $3,429.18
o	Egypt: $6,493.05
o	Ghana: $2,775.06
o	Kenya: $1,238.07
o	Morocco: $8,444.43
o	South Africa: $9,363.24
o	Tunisia: $51.06
*Nigeria experienced a substantial deficit in contrast to other African nations, all of which demonstrated positive profits.*

### Elements Affecting Nigeria's Results
• The average shipping cost from Nigeria to other African countries is $18.28; the average discount from Nigeria is 70.00%.
• Average Discount for Other African Countries: 0.00%
*Study*
•	Shipping Costs: Nigeria has a significantly lower average shipping cost compared to other African countries. Therefore, high shipping costs are not a contributing factor to Nigeria's poor performance.
•	Discounts: Nigeria along with the other 2 countries  has an extremely high average discount of 70%, while other African countries have no discounts on average. This high discount rate could be a major factor contributing to the negative profitability in Nigeria.

### Question 4: Identification of the least profitable product subcategory in Southeast Asia and recommendations on whether to continue offering these products in specific countries.
-the least  Profitable Product Subcategory in Southeast Asia
•	Subcategory: Tables
•	Total Profit: -$18,618.31 (Loss)
*Specific Country in Southeast Asia to Stop Offering Tables*
•	Indonesia shows the most significant loss, with about -$10,680.28 
Other countries like Thailand, the Philippines, and Myanmar also show substantial losses.
Given these results, Indonesia appears to be a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should consider stopping the offering of the "Tables" subcategory due to its significant unprofitability as well as Thailand, the Philippines and Myanmar. 

### Question 5: The least profitable city in terms of average profit in the United States and investigation into possible reasons.
The least profitable city in the United States, considering cities with at least 10 orders, is Lancaster. The average profit here is approximately -$157.37.
 Possible reasons for Lancaster's low average profit include:
•-High average discount: The mean discount offered in Lancaster is about 31.52%, which is relatively high and could be cutting into potential profits.
-Shipping costs: The average shipping cost in Lancaster is $23.99, which might not be adequately offset by sales revenue, impacting overall profitability

### Question 6: Identification of the product subcategory with the highest average profit in Australia.
-The product subcategory with the highest average profit is Appliances, with an average profit of approximately $139.01.

### Conclusion and Recommendation
Countries with low sales should emulate United State, China and India to improve on thier sales. Nigeria for Example, should increase thier discount and increase the shipping rate to enable consumers purchase it products. Customers with high purchase rates should be encouraged and recognised with a discount from their next purchase or a shopping voucher. This will encourage other customers to do better.
